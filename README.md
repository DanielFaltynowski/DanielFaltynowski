### 👨‍💻 About Me

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Applied Computer Science from the University of Gdańsk, and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science and Econometrics at the University of Gdańsk.

I have experience working on the Canal+ hotline, where I upsold premium products to customers with TV contracts. Thanks to this job, I gained a solid foundation in marketing and trend analysis, which inspired me to pursue a master’s degree in this field — but in a more technical, statistical, and data-driven context.

### 🌋 Interests

I am currently focusing heavily on practical data analysis using Excel, SQL, Python, and R. Above all, I am learning how to effectively process and explore data, build regression models, create corporate-standard visualizations, and formulate and test hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods.
